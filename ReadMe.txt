Instructions : 
	To compile our application you have two requirements that you have to respect. First, you have to assure that the files 'chr22.fa' and 
	'tags.txt' exist in the root folder of the extracted archive. Then, the second step is open a console in the root folder of the extracted
	archive and execute the following commands in the following order :

1) cd src

2) javac main/TestAutomatas.java

3) java main.TestAutomatas

After the above instructions have been executed, the file 'output.txt' will be created(or modified if it has already been created) with the
output information of our application. Respectively, the positions of each tag inside the grand text.

P.S.: The file 'output.txt' already exists in the archive, and it has the output of our last execution of the program.
